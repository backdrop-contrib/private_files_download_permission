Private files download permission
=================================

DESCRIPTION
----------------------------

The first version of this module provided "two useful features which Drupal
itself is missing: a simple permission to allow downloading of private files
by role, plus the ability to combine both public and private downloads".

Version 2.x removes the single permission and implements a by-role and
by-directory grid instead, in order for the administrator to better tweak the
whole system and increment the overall security.

Idea and code (mostly for version 1.x) were inspired by
http://www.beacon9.ca/labs/drupal-7-private-files-module.
